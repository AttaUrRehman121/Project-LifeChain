# LifeChain: Empowering Organ Donation with Machine Learning & Blockchain

## 📌 Project Overview

LifeChain is an innovative system that enhances **organ donation and transplantation** by integrating **Machine Learning (ML) and Blockchain** technologies. The goal is to create a **secure, transparent, and efficient** platform for matching donors and recipients, reducing mismatches, delays, and fraudulent activities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI-Powered Donor-Recipient Matching:** Uses **ML algorithms** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN) to find the most compatible matches.
- **Blockchain Smart Contracts:** Ensures **security, transparency, and immutability** of agreements.
- **User Roles:** Supports **donors, recipients, and admins** with separate dashboards.
- **Automated Compatibility Tests:** Provides instant predictions for organ compatibility.
- **Data Privacy & Security:** Blockchain-backed storage ensures **tamper-proof** records.
- **Interactive Reports & Analytics:** Displays insights on donor-recipient trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)
- **Backend:** Python (Django)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN)
- **Blockchain:** Smart Contracts for organ allocation
- **Database:** MySQL

## 📊 Machine Learning Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical data.
2. **Model Training:** Trains ML models on donor-recipient datasets.
3. **Prediction & Evaluation:** Uses `accuracy_score`, `f1_score`, `confusion_matrix`.
4. **Blockchain Integration:** Stores verified matches on a secure ledger.

## 🔬 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score**: Measures prediction correctness.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzes classification errors.
- **F1 Score**: Ensures balanced precision and recall.
